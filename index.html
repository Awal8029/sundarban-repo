            <p>Sundarbans is a mangrove area in the delta formed by the confluence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna
                Rivers in the Bay of Bengal. It spans the area from the Hooghly River in India's state of West Bengal to
                the
                Baleswar River in Bangladesh's division of Khulna. It comprises closed and open mangrove forests, land
                used
                for agricultural purpose, mudflats and barren land, and is intersected by multiple tidal streams and
                channels. Four protected areas in the Sundarbans are enlisted as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, viz.
                Sundarbans National Park, Sundarbans West, Sundarbans South and Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuaries.

            <h1>Save us</h1>
            <h2>It's time to save us</h2>
            <p>Sundarbans is the world's largest single block of mangrove forest. It falls under the UNESCO World
                Heritage Site, shared by India and Bangladesh at the mouth of the Ganges river.
                Sundarbans is facing the environmental issues such as rise in sea level, increase in salinity, man made
                hazards, deforestation etc. Such problems creates the migration of the people to the other parts of the
                country.
                Certain measures should be adopted to save the Sundarbans....</p>

                <h2 class="orange-color">One Of the main Reason</h2>
                <h3>There are approximately 70 species of mangroves around the world (Polidoro et al. 2010). When
                    activities such as logging, shrimp farming, coastal agriculture, hotel development, and other
                    activities are valued over the ecosystem services the intact mangroves provide, genetic diversity is
                    among the first—but least considered—casualty. The trees and associated species (e.g., birds,
                    snakes, crabs) are visibly lost, but so too are the specific genotypes and phenotypes that have
                    evolved in microhabitats around the world to withstand insects, tidal fluctuations, precipitation
                    patterns and salinity regimes</h3>

                <h3>Climate change is causing two important impacts along the world’s coastlines. Sea levels are rising
                    and the chemistry of the oceans is shifting (IPCC 2007 and NRC 2011). The rates at which these
                    impacts are occurring is likely to exceed the ability of mangrove forests and the species that live
                    within them to adapt (Gilman et al. 2008).</h3>
